Simpler

 * Benchmark/timing scripts in bash/python
 * Comment system
 * Readme
 * Code reformatting for width, whitespace conventions, readability.
 * Chinese -> English translation

Complex

 * Modular arrangement of files (separating calculation code from setup and in/output)
 * Tests (dependent on modular code)
 * Check matrix/linear algebra package to simplify calculation
